# EasyMySQL website

## Product and audience

EasyMySQL is a free, MIT-licensed native database and development application for Windows, macOS and Linux. It combines MariaDB server management, SQL editing, editable tables, ER diagrams, a visual query builder, imports/exports, MCP integration, code projects, a terminal and Git/GitHub tools. Developers working with local SQL databases are the inferred primary audience; this audience description follows the README and implemented feature set rather than user research.

The website helps visitors understand the application, inspect real screenshots and install the current release. Its scope is the public website, not the native application's interface.

## Durable constraints

- Preserve the established dark blue identity, locally hosted Instrument Sans and Martian Mono, real application screenshots and German/English behavior.
- Keep copy concise and concrete. Terminal installation precedes the equally discoverable direct Windows EXE, macOS and Linux file options near the top. Avoid a large script demonstration or filler content.
- Package availability comes from `/api/release` and the existing `/download/*` routes. Missing packages must have an explicit unavailable state. At this review the latest release lacks a macOS package; this does not mean the application lacks macOS support.
- Windows includes MariaDB. macOS and Linux require separate MariaDB installation; installation guidance must preserve that distinction.
- Show measured performance numerically and disclose scope. The recorded version 7.3.0 benchmark measures CPU UI preparation in headless egui: seven-run medians of 0.437 ms for a 50,000-row by 12-column grid and 0.127 ms for a cached 5,000-line SQL editor. Raw data is in `public/benchmarks.json`. It does not establish GPU presentation, query, startup, RAM or scrolling performance.
- Package-size comparisons are separate dated snapshots of exact application versions and downloaded byte counts, not runtime performance comparisons.
- Keep keyboard operation, visible focus, reduced-motion support and narrow-screen reading intact in both languages.

## Evidence

Product capabilities and platform requirements: `../README.md`. Website behavior and wording: `public/index.html`, `public/app.js` and `public/style.css`. Performance evidence: `public/benchmarks.json`. Refinement constraints derive from the user's website request and follow-ups.
